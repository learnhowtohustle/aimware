## <ins>How to use

1. Download obviously
2. Extract everything to 1 folder
3. Open CSGO
4. Open the included .EXE or use your own injector (included exe recommended)
5. Make sure under process it's "csgo"
6. Make sure module says "csgo-x86.dll"
7. I'm unsure about the other methods but just use the default one, "Thread"
8. LOAD IT!
9. Wait patiently it might take a minute or 2.
